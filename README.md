# NGINX-Configuration
This is the configuration file for nginx and any associated documentation for utilizing Cloudflare.

## Important Notes:
When setting up this service, check the nginx.conf file and make sure the file paths match for everything you are serving, or any pertinent SSL certificates.

### Cloudflare
Cloudflare is an amazing Domain Name Server (DNS). You may purchase or register a DNS from https://www.cloudflare.com/ and point it to your Inernet Protocol Address (IP). Generally speaking, you want the service to be proxied and strict SSL requirements set. You will get your SSL certificates generated by Cloudflare and this is typically the easiest way to handle it yourself without adding another third party service. Remember, the SSL certificaes will be in privkey.pem and fullchain.pem which is important to prevent hijacking your domain name.

Please note the difference between HTTP and HTTPS is dependent upon whether you have SSL certification from Cloudflare.
